# HelloWorld C++
Basic-ish (currently a mess) console application writen in c++ 
 
It currently has a password that you register to a file, basic calculators that does math with variables, Debug screen, and a Settings menu with an option to change the color of the console.

# Tools I use
The IDE I use is Visual Studio.

# Other Info
I use virtual folders for organizing source files, so once you open the project file it should look less like a mess in the IDE. 
 
When you run the program, it will prompt you to register a password. This will create a .txt file in the same folder the program is in, and the program will refer to that text file (if its in the same folder) for the password.
